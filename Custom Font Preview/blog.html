                                <p>Think of harmonizing design as choosing the right font, much like selecting furniture
                                    for a room. Furniture acts as interior design's partner in crime. It's the key to
                                    shaping a room according to its intended ambience. Using furniture that doesn't mesh
                                    with the room's concept can drastically alter the mood and appearance, throwing off
                                    the intended harmony.<br />On the other hand, Fonts constitute a pivotal element
                                    within graphic design, wielding substantial influence in crafting a design. If the
                                    selection or pairing of fonts doesn't align with the initially conceived concept,
                                    the design lacks internal harmony.</p>

                                    an interior designer,<br />
                                    holds a similar role.</h3>
                                <p>Think of harmonizing design as choosing the right font, much like selecting furniture
                                    for a room. Furniture acts as interior design's partner in crime. It's the key to
                                    shaping a room according to its intended ambience. Using furniture that doesn't mesh
                                    with the room's concept can drastically alter the mood and appearance, throwing off
                                    the intended harmony.<br />On the other hand, Fonts constitute a pivotal element
                                    within graphic design, wielding substantial influence in crafting a design. If the
                                    selection or pairing of fonts doesn't align with the initially conceived concept,
                                    the design lacks internal harmony.</p>

                            <p>Upon identifying the issues and drawing parallels between furniture and fonts, we made a
                                resolute decision: to create a font that would address our concerns about harmony. We
                                embarked on crafting a sans-serif typeface that seamlessly blends both Latin and
                                Balinese scripts. The choice of the Balinese script is a gesture of honour to our rich
                                culture. The seed of this idea was planted back in December 2022, during our studio's
                                rebranding discussions.<br>Our inspiration was drawn from type designer Aditia Bayu's
                                masterpiece 'Vimala,' released in 2018, and the timeless Font 'Bali Simbar' by I Made
                                Suatjana, dating back to 1995.<br />Engaging in lively discussions over cups of coffee,
                                we underwent a brainstorming process to define the contours of the font we envisioned.
                                Eventually, we chose to make a sans-serif font.</p>

                            <p>The Coffeestorming Session
                                After a few cups of coffee and some brainstorming, we decided to create a neo grotesque
                                sans
                                serif font with Latin and Balinese scripts. We started by exploring the Latin script,
                                and the first letter we looked at was "a".
                                Not because it's the first letter in the alphabet, of course. But because the letter "a"
                                is just so much fun to explore. It can be expanded into a number of other letters, and
                                it has a Neo grotesk accent that we wanted to capture in our font.
                                Working with the flow.
                                So we started with the letter "a" and gave it an aperture of 90 degrees. This gave the
                                letter a Neo grotesk accent, we also added a tail to the letter "a". This tail will be
                                applied to both the letter "a" and the letter "l".
                                We applied the same tilt spur and apperture to the lowercase letters "c,e,f,j,s,t,y" to
                                make the font having consistency. For example, the letter "f" has a same tilt on the
                                hooks to add stability to the font, and the next step, we digitized them.</p>

                                <p>we ran into a few problems. for example, we having problem with visual balancing.
                                    When we put the characters together into a word or even a sentence, they didn't look
                                    quite right.
                                    We wanted the stems of all the letters to be the same thickness, but we find out
                                    they were either too thick or too thin. but, we were able to fix these problems by
                                    using Font Remix tools (RMX).
                                    Once we fixed these problems, we were able to finish the character draft for the
                                    Latin script and we decided to continue and focus more on making Balinese letters.

                                <p>We were excited to start working on the Balinese script, but we quickly realized that
                                    it would be a challenge. The Balinese script is more complicated than Latin, and we
                                    had to consider how to make it dynamic and modern without compromising its
                                    functionality as a font.
                                    One of the biggest challenges was kerning. The Balinese script has a lot of
                                    diacritics, and it was tricky to get them to line up correctly. We also had to make
                                    sure that the characters didn't bump into each other.

                                    Finally, We were able to solve these challenges using glyphs feature called
                                    distance.
                                    We also had to consider how to make the Balinese script dynamic and modern. We
                                    didn't want to just create a copy of the traditional Balinese script. We wanted to
                                    create something that was new and exciting, but still respectful of the traditional
                                    script.

                                    In the end, we were able to create a font that we're really proud of. We think it's
                                    a great way to preserve the Balinese language and culture.</p>

                                <p>It is important to understand that using a non-Latin typeface on your device differs
                                    from employing a Latin typeface that utilizes a general keyboard. Non-Latin
                                    typefaces require a specialized keyboard known as the Keyman keyboard.
                                    To provide some context on the Keyman keyboard, it is a program designed to
                                    configure one language into another. In this context, it facilitates the
                                    reconfiguration of languages based on the Latin script into those utilizing
                                    non-Latin scripts, such as the Balinese language. Furthermore, Keyman can configure
                                    more than 2000 languages.

                                    The image below illustrates the Keyman keyboard on MacOS.


                                    You can directly download the Keyman keyboard from its official website [here]
                                    Before commencing its use, make sure that the configuration selected is Balinese
                                    Unicode script.
